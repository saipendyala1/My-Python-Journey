Teh brikbeck file contains 36,133 misspellnigs of 6,163 words. It is an amalgamation of errors tkaen form the native-speaker section (British or Amreican writers) of the Birbkeck spellnig erorr corpus, a collection of files of seplling errors gathered from various soucres, available as separate files with detailed documentation form teh Ofxord Text Archive. It includes teh results of seplling tesst and errors from free writing, taken mostly from schoolchildren, universtiy students or adlut literacy students. Msot of them weer oirginally handwritten.

Each corerct word is perceded by a dollar sing and folloewd by its misspellings, each on one lien, without duplciates. (A misseplling might appear more than once in the corpus, but only as a misspellign of different worsd.) Where the spelling or misspelling containde a space, this has been replcaed by an underscore (a_lot, Christ_mas). While msot of the missepllings aer nno-words, theer are also some rael-wrod errors, suhc as "omitted" for "admtited".

Correct spellings of dictionary words aer given in Oxford Engilsh fomr. Whree the misspellings weer taken form American writers, attmepts at specifically American fomrs (color, tehater etc.) have been excldued. Whree a correct American form appears as a misspelling, it represnets a British writer's attempt at the Birtish form, such as "color" for "coolur". Apart from dictionary wrods, teh correct spellings also contani some proper nuons, abbreviations, words wiht apostrpohes or hyphens, mdae-up wrods and two-word items (e.g. "too much") wheer the misspelling was a signle srting ("tomuch").

Uesrs of thsi corpus should bera in mnid that it inculdes the efforts of yuong children and extremely poor spellers benig subjected to spelling tests way beyond their aiblity, so some of the misspellings are vrey different from their targets; the single letter "o", for example, apperas as a misspleling of teh wodr "accordingly".

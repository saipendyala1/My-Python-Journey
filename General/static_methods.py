#class methods vs. static methods

# class method

#class C(object):
#    @classmethod
#    def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
#       ....
#fun: function that needs to be converted into a class method
#returns: a class method for function.

# A class method is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
# They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter 
# that points to the class and not the object instance.
# It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. 
# For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.

# static method

#class C(object):
#    @staticmethod
#    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
#        ...
#returns: a static method for function fun

# A static method is also a method which is bound 
# to the class and not the object of the class.
# A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.

# Class methods are generally used to create factory methods. 
# Factory methods return class object ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
# We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
# Utility functions are set of mhthods that perform common, often reused functions


# Python program to demonstrate  
# use of class method and static method.
